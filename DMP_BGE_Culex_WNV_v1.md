#DATA MANAGEMENT PLAN 

##   PROJECT DATA: 
* Project number: 101059492
* Project acronym: BGE
* Project name: Biodiversity Genomics Europe
* Data management plan for case study: Comparative and population genomics of Culex mosquitoes in a West Nile Virus hotspot in Andalucía, Spain
* Work package: WPK11

## DATA MANAGEMENT PLAN
* Date: 22/10/2025
* Version: 1.0

## DATA SUMMARY
*Re-use of existing data:*
Existing genomic resources were re-used, including the publicly available Culex pipiens reference genome and published genomic datasets used for ecotype validation. Re-use was essential to ensure comparability and robust evolutionary inference. No relevant existing data were discarded.

*Types and formats of data:*
- Raw sequencing data (FASTQ)
- Genome assemblies (FASTA)
- Gene annotations (GFF3, protein FASTA)
- Variant data (VCF)
- Metadata (CSV, ENA/ERGA manifests)
- Analysis outputs (tables, figures)
- Code and workflows (scripts, markdown)

*Purpose of data generation:*
Data generation supports comparative genomics, population genomics, insecticide resistance analysis, and applied vector management recommendations aligned with project objectives.

*Expected data size:*
Several terabytes of raw sequencing data; processed and archived datasets are substantially smaller.

*Origin/provenance:*
Data originate from field-collected mosquito specimens sampled in Andalucía (Spain) in 2022, and from re-used public genomic resources.

*Data utility:*
Useful to mosquito genomics researchers, public health agencies, biodiversity genomics initiatives, and vector control authorities.

## FAIR DATA
*Findability:*
All datasets will be deposited in ENA with persistent identifiers (BioProject, BioSample, Run accessions). Rich metadata following ERGA and ENA standards will be provided. Keywords and controlled vocabularies will be included to maximize discoverability. Metadata will be harvestable and indexed by public repositories.

*Accessibility:*
Repositories: European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), Digital-CSIC, COPO
All data will be openly accessible by the end of the project (February 2026) or after publication whatever comes first. No embargo is foreseen after the end of the project. Data will be accessible via standardized, free protocols (HTTPS/FTP). Metadata will be openly available under CC0. No access restrictions or data access committee are required.

*Interoperability:*
Standard community formats (FASTQ, FASTA, BAM, VCF, CSV, GFF3) and ERGA/ENA metadata standards will be used. Qualified references to related datasets and previous studies will be included. No project-specific ontologies are generated.

*Reusability:*
Extensive documentation (README files, pipelines, parameter descriptions) will accompany the data. Data will be released under open licences consistent with Horizon Europe requirements. Provenance will be fully documented. Quality assurance includes sequencing QC, variant filtering, replication checks, and validation against reference datasets.

### OTHER RESEARCH OUTPUTS
Other outputs include genome assemblies, annotations, analytical pipelines, and scripts. These will be shared openly via GitHub and public repositories, following FAIR principles where applicable.

### ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES
Costs for data management are covered by institutional infrastructure and project funding. CSIC/EBD provides storage, archiving, and long-term stewardship. Maria José Ruiz-Lopez is responsible for data management. Long-term preservation is ensured via ENA and GitHub, with effectively unlimited retention.

### DATA SECURITY
During the project, data are stored on secure institutional servers with regular backups. Final datasets are archived in trusted international repositories ensuring long-term preservation and integrity.

### ETHICS
No ethical or legal issues affect data sharing. Mosquitoes are exempt from animal ethics approval, no personal data are involved, and GDPR does not apply. All sampling complied with Spanish and EU legislation.

### OTHER ISSUES
The project follows CSIC institutional data management policies and ERGA population genomics standards, fully aligned with Horizon Europe requirements.

### UPDATES: 
Data management plan will be updated once all the links are available and with any forseen modification.
